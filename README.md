## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter from Philo's perspective, using the same stream-of-consciousness style, as he travels to the harbour and contemplates his own exile, beauty, and the mark Leander left on him.
- Expand on Damon's character. Write a scene where he confronts Leander about his obsession, drawing from his own understanding of love, duty, and the city's expectations.
- Create a 'found text'—a clay tablet, a torn scroll, a philosopher's fragment—that comments on the nature of desire and mortality, discovered by Leander or Philo.
- Write the scene of the Spartan trainer's youth, exploring the discipline of the body and the suppression of emotion, casting a new light on his observation of Leander and Philo.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'mote of dust' visualization where each spinning particle contains a fragment of Leander's memory, forming a navigable cloud of his consciousness.
- Create a text generator that mimics the novel's prose style: short, sensory sentences blending classical imagery with modern psychological depth, using the opening chapter as a seed.
